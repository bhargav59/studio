# CloudEngineered

Welcome to **CloudEngineered**, an AI-powered web application designed for discovering, comparing, and reviewing the latest tools in cloud engineering and DevOps. This project leverages generative AI to create in-depth, high-quality technical content, providing valuable insights for professionals in the field.

## Key Features

-   **AI-Generated Tool Reviews**: Browse a collection of detailed, well-structured reviews for popular tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and more. All content is generated by AI.
-   **Discover & Review**: Automatically discover trending tools from GitHub using the GitHub API. With a single click, you can generate a brand new, comprehensive review for a discovered tool.
-   **Dynamic Comparison Engine**: Compare different tools side-by-side based on a list of features you provide. The AI generates a comparison table, a summary, and a "winner" based on the criteria.
-   **Admin Dashboard**: A password-protected dashboard provides an overview of site activity, including affiliate revenue, recently generated reviews, and trending tools.
-   **Modern UI/UX**: Built with Next.js, ShadCN UI, and Tailwind CSS for a responsive, clean, and modern user experience, including light and dark modes.

## Tech Stack

-   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   **UI Components**: [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
-   **Generative AI**: [Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit)
-   **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)

## Getting Started

To get the application running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Google AI API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server**:
    The application consists of two main parts: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI flows. You'll need to run both concurrently in separate terminals.

    -   **Terminal 1: Run the Next.js App**
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        This will start the web application on [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

    -   **Terminal 2: Run the Genkit Flows**
        ```bash
        npm run genkit:dev
        ```
        This starts the Genkit development server, which makes the AI flows available to the Next.js application.

4.  **Access the App**:
    -   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) to see the public reviews.
    -   To access the protected dashboard, navigate to `/admin` and use the password `password`.

## Project Structure

-   `src/app/`: Contains all the pages and routes for the application, following the Next.js App Router structure.
-   `src/ai/flows/`: All Genkit AI flows are defined here. Each file typically represents a specific AI-driven task.
-   `src/components/`: Shared React components used throughout the application, including UI components from ShadCN.
-   `src/lib/`: Core utilities, mock data, and type definitions for the application.
-   `src/services/`: Contains services for interacting with external APIs, such as the GitHub API.
