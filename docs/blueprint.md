## Core Features:

- Automated Tool Review Generation: Leverage AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic) to automatically generate comprehensive reviews for cloud engineering and DevOps tools based on extracted data and performance metrics. The tool will look at website_url, github_url to form the initial review.
- Dynamic Comparison Engine: Create a dynamic comparison table using AI to summarize feature matrices and provide a scoring system. Generates visual comparison charts to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of different tools. The AI can act as a tool, choosing whether or not the individual pieces of data will add signal or noise to the comparison.
- Tool Discovery via GitHub Monitoring: Monitor GitHub repositories to discover trending cloud engineering and DevOps tools. Automatically categorize tools by type and use case using web scraping and AI-driven analysis of documentation and website content.
- Affiliate Link Insertion: Automatically insert affiliate links into tool reviews and comparison articles. Track clicks, conversions, and commissions to optimize revenue generation.
- Personalized Tool Recommendations: Provide personalized tool recommendations based on user roles (cloud engineer, DevOps, manager) and preferences. Allow users to save favorite tools and comparisons.
- User Comment and Review System: Implement a system for users to rate, review, and leave comments on tools and comparisons.
- SEO Optimization: Implement automated sitemap generation and meta tag optimization to improve search engine rankings.
